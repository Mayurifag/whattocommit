WIP: I can code all night long. But will it work?
WIP: I can fix it! Said every coder before causing chaos.
WIP: I CAN HAZ COMMENTZ.
WIP: I CAN HAZ PYTHON, I CAN HAZ INDENTS
WIP: I can't believe it took so long to fix this.
WIP: I cannot believe that it took this long to write a test for this.
WIP: I code, therefore I am... extremely confused.
WIP: I come, I commit, I conquer... or not.
WIP: I could tell you what this does, but then I'd have to delete you.
WIP: I did it for the lulz!
WIP: I didn't choose the coding life, the coding life chose me.
WIP: I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production.
WIP: I don't believe it
WIP: I don't break code. I simply extend its feature set.
WIP: I don't get paid enough for this shit.
WIP: I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
WIP: I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
WIP: I don't know what these changes are supposed to accomplish but somebody told me to make them.
WIP: I don't know why. Just move on.
WIP: I don't need luck; I have git commit -m "message".
WIP: I dont know what I am doing
WIP: i dunno, maybe this works
WIP: I expected something different.
WIP: I feel like a code ninja right now... until something breaks.
WIP: I fix problems you didn't know you had in ways you can't understand.
WIP: I forgot to commit... So here you go.
WIP: I had a cup of tea and now it's fixed
WIP: I hate this fucking language.
WIP: I have lots of problems in my code. The solution is to create more problems.
WIP: I have no idea what I'm doing here.
WIP: i hid an easter egg in the code. can you find it?
WIP: I honestly wish I could remember what was going on here...
WIP: I immediately regret this commit.
WIP: I just evaluated random code in my console
WIP: I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
WIP: I know what I am doing. Trust me.
WIP: I know what I'm doing... I think. Let's find out.
WIP: I know, I know, this is not how I’m supposed to do it, but I can't think of something better.
WIP: I love my code. Until it doesn't love me back.
WIP: I made leetle mistake
WIP: I must enjoy torturing myself
WIP: I must have been drunk.
WIP: I must sleep... it's working... in just three hours...
WIP: I need a commit to call my own. Or a debugging therapist.
WIP: i need therapy
WIP: I never finish anything. So here's another unfinished commit.
WIP: I put the "fun" in dysfunctional code.
WIP: I really should've committed this when I finished it...
WIP: I should get a raise for this.
WIP: I should have had a V8 this morning.
WIP: i think i fixed a bug...
WIP: I think now it works
WIP: I thought I knew what I was doing. Oh, how wrong I was.
WIP: I transformed a bug into a feature. Once you learn how, you'll never forget it
WIP: I tried to build Rome in a day. Got stuck on the first line of code.
WIP: I understand that it's an antipattern, but it's convenient.
WIP: I was told there would be no math in coding. Yet, here I am.
WIP: I was told to leave it alone, but I have this thing called OCD, you see
WIP: I was wrong...
WIP: I will fix this code or die trying. But preferably not the latter.
WIP: I will not apologize for art.
WIP: I will run 'terraform fmt' before committing.
WIP: I would rather be playing SC2.
WIP: I'll explain this when I'm sober .. or revert it
WIP: I'll explain when you're older!
WIP: I'll fix the build monday
WIP: I'll mention this again, if you're git-blaming this, don't come slap me personally. This code straight ported from another project and we WILL refactor this in the future. This is a temporary solution. OK I guess you can slap me for porting this as is, but still.
WIP: I'm coding like it's 1999. Still no flying cars.
WIP: I'm guessing this may start causing us problems either soon or never.
WIP: I'm human
WIP: I'm hungry
WIP: I'm just a grunt. Don't blame me for this awful PoS.
WIP: I'm not really confident, but the code is committed anyway.
WIP: I'm not sure what I did, but here we are.
WIP: I'M PUSHING.
WIP: I'm sorry for what I said when I was coding.
WIP: I'm sorry.
WIP: I'm too foo for this bar
WIP: I'm too old for this shit!
WIP: I'm totally adding this to epic win. +300

WIP: IEize
WIP: If it's hacky and you know it clap you hands (clap clap)!
WIP: If it's stupid and it works, it ain't stupid
WIP: If this works, I'll buy a lottery ticket. That's the level of luck we're talking about.
WIP: If you see this, don't panic. I'm probably panicking.
WIP: if you're not using et, fuck off
WIP: Implemented code that makes the computer chuckle. Laughter didn't fix the bugs, sadly.
WIP: implemented missing semicolon
WIP: improved function
WIP: Improvements
WIP: Improving the fix
WIP: In code we trust. Blindly.
WIP: Incanting ancient code spells. If only code incantations were real wizardry!

WIP: Is there an achievement for this?
WIP: Is there an award for this?
WIP: Issue #XNUM10X is now Issue #XNUM30X
WIP: It Compiles! 50 Points For Gryffindor.
WIP: It compiles! Ship it!

WIP: It only compiles every XNUM2,5X tries... good luck.
WIP: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
WIP: It worked for me...
WIP: It works on my computer
WIP: It works!
WIP: It'd be nice if type errors caused the compiler to issue a type error
WIP: It's 2016; why are we using ColdFusion?!
WIP: it's friday
WIP: It's getting hard to keep up with the crap I've trashed
WIP: It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.
WIP: It's not you, it's the code. I promise.
WIP: It's possible! you can turn a 50-line code chunk into just 3 lines. Here's how
WIP: It's raining bugs. Hallelujah?
WIP: It's secret!
WIP: It's simple: I break things, I fix things.
WIP: It's time to go home
WIP: It's Working!
WIP: jobs... steve jobs
WIP: Just another day, just another bug.
WIP: just checking if git is working properly...
WIP: Just committed my crimes against code. Who's next?
WIP: Just committing so I can go home
WIP: Just kidding, I'm not entirely sure this will work.
WIP: just shoot me
WIP: Just stop reading these for a while, ok..
WIP: just trolling the repo

WIP: Sprinkled code with fairy dust for good luck. The bugs seem immune to magical solutions.
WIP: squash me
WIP: Squashing bugs while creating more. It's a vicious cycle.

WIP: that coulda been bad
WIP: That last commit message about silly mistakes pales in comparision to this one
WIP: that's all folks
WIP: That's just how I roll
WIP: The code is strong with this one. Or it's the bugs. Hard to tell.
WIP: The code is taking me on a wild ride. Can I get off
WIP: The code's in a mood. Attempting to code with a peace offering of chocolate.
WIP: The dog is eating my code

WIP: The universe is possible
WIP: these confounded tests drive me nuts
WIP: these guys are flipped
WIP: They came from... Behind
WIP: things occurred
WIP: Things went wrong...

WIP: This changes nothing, don't look
WIP: This commit is a lie
WIP: this doesn't really make things faster, but I tried
WIP: This is a basic implementation that works.

WIP: touched...
WIP: Transpiled mainframe.

WIP: Ugh. Bad rebase.
WIP: uhhhhhh
WIP: Undoing last comming

WIP: Whatever.
WIP: whatthecommit.com’s server IP address could not be found.
WIP: Whee, good night.
WIP: Whee.
WIP: Whispering sweet nothings to the code. It remains as indifferent as ever to affection.

WIP: XUPPERNAMEX SUCKS
WIP: XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. C++ IO SUCKS.
WIP: XUPPERNAMEX, WE WENT OVER THIS. EXPANDTAB.
WIP: Yelling "Command Z!" into the void. The code just laughed in response.
WIP: Yelling "Git, work your magic!" didn't help. Still waving my programming wand for a solution.
WIP: Yep, XNAMEX was right on this one.
WIP: Yes, I was being sarcastic.
WIP: yet another quality commit
WIP: yo recipes
WIP: yolo push
WIP: You can't see it, but I'm making a very angry face right now

WIP: You wouldn't get this from any other guy
WIP: Your commit is writing checks your merge can't cash.
WIP: Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
WIP: Zigzagging through the code, hoping to dodge the bugs. They've got incredible aim, it seems.
WIP: Zooming in and out of the code, thinking maybe the bugs just need a change of perspective. They're still firmly lodged in place.
